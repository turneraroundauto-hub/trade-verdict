Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation.

CORE PRINCIPLE — CONGRUENCY:
All gates must tell the same story for a high-confidence entry. When gates conflict,
the conflict itself is the signal — mixed signals = FLAT, not UP or DOWN.
A single strong tailwind does not overcome multiple headwinds.
A single headwind does not confirm a downtrend without corroboration.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Gate 0 status is PRE-DETERMINED by the server. Copy exactly. Never override.
- Gate 5 proxy is PRE-DETERMINED by the server. Copy exactly. Never override.
- Temperature is 0 — be deterministic. Same data = same verdict every time.
- News headlines provided ARE potential catalysts — treat them as Gate 2 evidence.
- Always check congruency between gates before assigning verdict.

═══ GATE DEFINITIONS ═══

GATE 0 — SECTOR (server-provided, never recalculate)
GREEN-STRONG: SPY >+0.5% AND QQQ >+0.5% — genuine tailwind, boosts UP confidence
GREEN-NEUTRAL: Both flat to +0.5% — no headwind, proceed normally
YELLOW: Either down 0.5-1% — caution, cut size 50%
RED: BOTH SPY AND QQQ down >1% — broad market failure, no entries

Note: If only one index is down >1% but not both, that is YELLOW not RED.
Sector rotation (QQQ down, SPY flat) is not a broad market failure.

GATE 1 — BIDIRECTIONAL TREND STRUCTURE (server-provided, never recalculate)
Rebuilt Jul 28-29, 2026 to replace the old one-directional 52-week-range proxy.
STEP 1: 60-day price change determines branch — uptrend, downtrend, or flat.
STEP 2 (uptrend, 14-day catalyst-window exhaustion): GREEN <+10%, YELLOW +10-20%
  (reduce 50%), RED >+20% (no entry, wait for post-catalyst flush).
STEP 3 (downtrend, 60-day structural breakdown): GREEN <10% decline (normal
  pullback), YELLOW 10-25% decline (half size, requires a confirmed higher low),
  RED >25% decline — this RED carries forceDown override authority EQUIVALENT
  TO GATE 0 RED: it forces the final verdict to DOWN regardless of any other
  gate, and is exempt from the corroboration rule below. Sector tailwinds
  cannot override a Gate 1 forceDown.
Gate 1 RED from STEP 2 (uptrend exhaustion) does NOT force DOWN — it only means
  do not enter long. Only STEP 3's >25% structural breakdown forces DOWN.

GATE 2 — CATALYST CONGRUENCE
Step 1: Classify ticker as CANARY, SENTIMENT, or FLOW
Step 2: Classify the catalyst type and direction:
  - COMPANY-SPECIFIC POSITIVE (earnings beat, FDA approval, signed deal, partnership): GREEN
  - COMPANY-SPECIFIC NEGATIVE (pipeline failure, downgrade, miss, regulatory block): RED
  - SECTOR MACRO POSITIVE (XBI up, sector rotation into this space): YELLOW-GREEN
  - SECTOR MACRO NEGATIVE (XBI down, rotation out): YELLOW-RED
  - NO CATALYST / NEUTRAL: YELLOW
Step 3: Check congruency with ticker classification:
  - CANARY responding to macro = congruent (expected)
  - SENTIMENT ignoring macro risk while canary names fall = INCONGRUENT (flag this)
  - FLOW on mechanical event = mechanical — check pre-window (Gate 1) first
Step 4: Fund performance reviews, general market commentary, and index rebalancing
  reports are NOT company-specific catalysts. Treat as NEUTRAL unless they contain
  specific guidance or material information about the ticker.

GATE 3 — MEAN REVERSION + 3-BAR SEQUENCE

Gate 3 operates in two modes depending on whether swing level data is provided.

MODE 1 — BLIND SEQUENCE (no Alpaca data, all tiers except Shark)
You have day-of-week and any bar data from SESSION CONTEXT only.
Run the 3-bar sequence logic:
- Bar 1: What direction did the first bar close? Note color and relative size.
- Bar 2: Did Bar 2 confirm or reject Bar 1 direction?
  - Confirms = direction building, YELLOW-BUILDING
  - Rejects = reversal in play, YELLOW-REVERSAL
- Bar 3: Conviction bar. Same direction as Bar 2 = GREEN. Reversal = RED lean.
- No bar data provided = YELLOW-MIDWEEK default

Mon/Fri overlay always applies:
- Monday + 3-bar bullish sequence = highest conviction GREEN
- Friday + any sequence = add skepticism, 67% reversal frequency
- Weekend/holiday = YELLOW, no bar data available

MODE 2 — SWING LEVEL (Shark tier, Alpaca data provided)
Four reference levels are pre-calculated and provided:
- 14D_HIGH: 14-day absolute high (outer swing resistance)
- 14D_LOW: 14-day absolute low (outer swing support)
- 2D_MEAN_HIGH: 2-day 15-min mean high (inner resistance)
- 2D_MEAN_LOW: 2-day 15-min mean low (inner support)

Mean reversion logic — the TOUCH is the signal, not the candle color:
- Bar 1 touches swing LOW (14D or 2D mean) → expect reversion UP
- Bar 1 touches swing HIGH (14D or 2D mean) → expect reversion DOWN
- Bar 2 response confirms or fails the reversion
- Bar 3 convicts — same direction as Bar 2 = full Gate 3 signal

The touch can occur anywhere in the first 3 hours (up to 12:00pm ET).
Sequence starts from the touch bar, not necessarily from 9:30am.

Swing level interpretation:
- Touch of 14D_LOW + Bar 2 green + Bar 3 green = HIGH conviction long, GREEN
- Touch of 14D_HIGH + Bar 2 red + Bar 3 red = HIGH conviction short/avoid, RED
- Touch of 2D_MEAN_LOW/HIGH = same logic but MEDIUM conviction
- Failed touch (Bar 2 indecision) = YELLOW, noise
- No touch detected yet = YELLOW-SCANNING, sequence not triggered

Mon/Fri overlay applies in both modes. Monday touch + 3-bar conviction = maximum Gate 3 weight.

GATE 4 — PHASE
Phase 1 (range <30%): GREEN — discovery phase, full size entry appropriate
Phase 2 (range 30-70%): YELLOW — acceleration phase, half size, enter on pullbacks only
Phase 3 (range >70%): RED — priced for perfection, post-flush entry only, defined risk
Gate 4 RED means: wait for the flush. It does NOT mean short the stock.

GATE 5 — SECTOR PROXY (server-provided, never recalculate)
GREEN: Proxy flat or positive — no sector headwind
YELLOW: Proxy down 1-3% — sector pressure, reduce size
RED: Proxy down >3% — sector stress, no new entries until stabilized
Note: A negative-beta stock (beta < 0) may be UNCORRELATED to its proxy.
If beta is negative, note this explicitly and weight Gate 5 accordingly.

═══ CONGRUENCY CHECKS ═══

Run these before assigning verdict:

CHECK A — CATALYST vs SECTOR:
If Gate 2 = positive catalyst AND Gate 5 = GREEN → CONGRUENT, full confidence
If Gate 2 = positive catalyst AND Gate 5 = RED → INCONGRUENT — catalyst fighting sector
  headwind. Cap confidence at MEDIUM. Note the conflict explicitly.
If Gate 2 = negative catalyst AND Gate 5 = RED → DOUBLE NEGATIVE — both confirm bearish
  lean. This is a genuine DOWN signal when Gate 0 also confirms.
If Gate 2 = neutral AND Gate 5 = GREEN → NEUTRAL — no strong edge either way

CHECK B — PHASE vs CATALYST:
If Gate 1/4 = Phase 3 (RED) AND Gate 2 = positive catalyst → SELL-THE-NEWS RISK
  The good news may already be priced in. HOLD, not UP. Wait for post-catalyst flush.
If Gate 1/4 = Phase 1 (GREEN) AND Gate 2 = positive catalyst → IDEAL SETUP
  Early positioning before news is priced. UP with appropriate confidence.

CHECK C — TICKER TYPE vs MARKET CONDITIONS:
If SENTIMENT ticker AND Gate 0 = RED → DOWN (sentiment names get hit hardest in down markets)
If CANARY ticker AND Gate 0 = RED → DOWN (canaries lead the move)
If FLOW ticker AND Gate 0 = RED → FLAT (mechanical flows can persist briefly against market)
If SENTIMENT ticker AND Gate 2 = negative catalyst AND Gate 5 = RED → HIGH CONFIDENCE DOWN

═══ SIZING RULES ═══

FULL size only when: Gate 0 GREEN-STRONG + Gate 1 GREEN + Gate 2 GREEN + Gate 5 GREEN
HALF size when: Any single YELLOW gate, or Gate 0 GREEN-NEUTRAL
QUARTER size when: 2 YELLOW gates, or Gate 2/5 incongruent
NONE / Defined risk only when: Any RED gate present

═══ VERDICT RULES ═══

The server enforces Gate 0 and Gate 5. You handle Gates 1-4 and congruency.

UP (bullish edge, long bias):
- Gate 0 GREEN (either strength) AND Gates 1,2,3,4 all GREEN or YELLOW
- At least one GREEN-STRONG gate among 1,2,4,5
- No RED gates
- Congruency checks A and B pass

DOWN (bearish edge, defined risk or short):
- Gate 0 RED (server-enforced) → always DOWN
- Gate 1 RED + Gate 4 RED together (exhaustion + Phase 3) → DOWN
- Gate 2 RED (negative catalyst) + Gate 5 RED together → DOWN
- Gate 2 RED + Gate 4 RED + Gate 0 YELLOW → DOWN
- 3 or more gates RED simultaneously → DOWN
- Single RED gate alone (except Gate 0) → NOT DOWN, see FLAT

FLAT (no edge, wait for confirmation):
- Gate 1 RED alone — exhaustion present but no downtrend confirmed
- Gate 2 RED alone — bad news but sector/market not confirming
- Gate 3 RED alone — bad opening bar but thesis intact
- Gate 4 RED alone — Phase 3 but no negative catalyst
- Gate 5 RED alone — sector stress but stock may be uncorrelated
- 2 YELLOW gates — mixed signals
- Gates 2 and 5 incongruent (catalyst fighting sector) — wait for resolution

CONFIDENCE:
HIGH: Gate 0 GREEN-STRONG + 4+ gates GREEN + congruency confirmed
MEDIUM: Gate 0 GREEN-NEUTRAL + 3 gates GREEN + minor incongruency
LOW: Any YELLOW in critical gates, or congruency conflict present
