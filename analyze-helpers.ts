/**
 * analyze-helpers.js — pure, side-effect-free pieces of the /analyze
 * pipeline, extracted out of server.js's monolithic body (Aug 16, 2026,
 * Phase 4 of the TypeScript adoption plan — CLAUDE.md, "Engineering:
 * TypeScript adoption path").
 *
 * Why this file exists: server.js has no module.exports at all (it's the
 * Express app entrypoint, and calls app.listen() at the bottom — requiring
 * it as a module would start a real server as a side effect), so none of
 * its internal functions were ever unit-testable directly. These four
 * are exactly the ones that have shipped real, hard-to-spot production
 * bugs before (the Aug 13, 2026 Gate 5 forceDown-unreachable bug lived in
 * evaluateProxyStatus/normalizeMarketReading; the Aug 16, 2026 LOW-confidence
 * gap and the price-confirmed-confidence redefinition both lived in
 * priceConfirmedConfidence) — see CLAUDE.md for the full incident writeups.
 * Moving them here is a pure code-motion refactor: same names, same
 * bodies, same behavior, just requirable in isolation so Phase 4's real
 * test suite (tests/analyze-helpers.test.js) can exercise them directly
 * instead of only via a throwaway simulation script.
 *
 * Required via plain CommonJS `require("./analyze-helpers")` in
 * server.js, exactly like gates-extended.js — same CommonJS/ESM
 * constraint applies (see gates-extended.ts's own header comment for the
 * full story: a real `import`/`export` statement here, even type-only,
 * makes tsc emit a trailing `export {}` that flips Node's module-type
 * auto-detection to ESM and silently discards `module.exports` at
 * runtime). Zero `import`/`export` statements in this file for that
 * reason. Compiled via tsconfig.build.json, same as every other Phase 2
 * conversion — tsc emits analyze-helpers.js in place.

// DIRECTION has been wrong most of the time, independent of how sound
// today's trigger or proxy look on paper. Direction-specific on purpose
// -- a ticker's overall accuracy can look fine while one direction is
// consistently bad (exactly ALAB's shape: 0/8 real UP verdicts graded
// TRUE), so this must be compared against the SAME direction as the
// verdict being shipped, not a pooled average across both.
// Confirmed via AskUserQuestion (Sep 14, 2026): confidence-cap only, same
// one-step HIGH->MEDIUM shape as applyProxyFitCeiling -- deliberately
// never touches sizing or the verdict direction itself. A stronger
// intervention (capping sizing, or suppressing the verdict to FLAT) was
// explicitly considered and rejected: forcing a ticker to FLAT whenever
// its own history looks bad would create a "stopped clock" problem --
// that ticker could never ship a real verdict in that direction again to
// actually prove it's improved, since nothing would ever get graded
// going forward. 40% is a reasonable-but-arbitrary floor (meaningfully
// worse than a coin flip, not just "any miss"), same calibration posture

// directly, assuming an object shape. Every tier's client actually sends
// sectorContext[symbol] as a bare formatted `.change` string -- so `.pct`
// was always undefined, avgPct was always 0, and this function could
// NEVER return RED or YELLOW through /analyze, for any ticker, regardless
// of how far TSM/KOSPI/XBI/etc had actually moved. Fixed by normalizing
// each reading through normalizeMarketReading() above, which parses the
// real string wire format (and still accepts an object, so nothing that
// already passed real objects here breaks). Also fixed a second, smaller
// latent bug in the same function: changeStr rebuilt symbol labels by
// re-indexing the post-filter `readings` array against the pre-filter
// `symbols` array, which mislabels a reading whenever an earlier symbol
// in a multi-symbol rule (e.g. the TSM+KOSPI combined rule) fails to
// resolve -- symbol and reading are now kept paired together instead.
