// Company/Industry Knowledge Graph — Phase 1 proof-of-concept seed
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Standalone script, not loaded by server.js — run by hand once Neo4j
// credentials are set (`node neo4j-seed.js`) to prove the Phase 1
// plumbing (neo4j-graph.js) end-to-end against the exact example from
// the original design conversation:
//
//   TSMC
//    ├── supplies → NVIDIA
//    ├── supplies → AMD
//    ├── supplies → Apple
//    ├── buys equipment from → ASML
//    ├── buys equipment from → Applied Materials
//    └── competes with → Samsung
//
// Real seed data (a small, hand-curated starting set), not a placeholder
// — but deliberately small in scope for Phase 1: proving the graph shape
// works, not attempting real market-wide coverage yet. Safe to re-run
// (every upsert is a Neo4j MERGE) — running this twice does not create
// duplicate nodes or edges.
